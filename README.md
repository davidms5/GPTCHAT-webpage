this is a challenge frontpage to learn the uses of css and react, it's responsive in different devices' screens. it was build using vite and pnpm package manager for the 
package.json but it is ok to use the classic npm if any person wanted to. to run it locally just download the repository with zip or just clone it with the link in the green 
code that says "CODE", get in the folder where you stored the code and install the dependencies using npm or pnpm i.

to run the code locally just type in the terminal npm or pnpm run dev
